I changed these files to make them fit the new caffe version. (It's OK now for caffe version: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe 2017/8/19)

Please compare caffe.proto-org and caffe.proto to see differences.(You can use a tool named Beyond Compare.)



Usage:

1, Download caffe from https://github.com/BVLC/caffe. Be sure to install caffe correctly.

2, Copy files.

Copy all *\*.cpp/\*.cu*  files into *src/caffe/layers/*


Copy all *\*.hpp*  files into *include/caffe/layers/*


Replace the old *src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto* with the new one given.

3, Recompile caffe

*make clean*

*make  all*
